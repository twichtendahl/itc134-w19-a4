		<!-- Overview -->
		<p id="cc-intro">
		  Cloud computing refers to a wide range of computing infrastructure services--from storage to software--that
		  are delivered over the internet to a customer (normally a company). These services used to be in the scope of
		  a company's IT department. But with cloud computing, these services can be handled by a third-party so
		  companies can focus on their core business.

			<h3>Models of Cloud Computing</h3>
			<p>Cloud Computing Services are broken into three main groups:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li class="dist_type">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>Description: This is the lowest level of cloud computing. IaaS provides servers and storage,
				  networking and security. Think of it like a company's traditional data center, but completely virtual.
				  The customer accesses these services through a user interface. Examples include Microsoft Azure or Amazon
				  Web Services.
				</li>
				<li>Benefits:</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>You can purchase services individually as you need them. This makes IaaS scalable with
					businesses of all sizes</li>
				  <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/">Microsoft's page on IaaS</a> states
					that new services can be deployed in less than a day. When you've decided you need a new
					component of IaaS, you can have it up and running that same day, rather than waiting weeks to set up
					local resources.</li>
				  <li>Disaster recovery with the cloud is significantly easier than with a traditional data center. In an
					 <a href="http://web.onlinetech.com/disaster-recovery-answers-all-in-one-place">excerpt from a white
					   paper on disaster recovery in cloud computing</a>, Online Tech writes that
					your infrastructure "...can be safely and accurately transferred from one data center to a second
					data center without the burden of reloading each component of the server. This can dramatically
					reduce recovery times compared to conventional (non-virtualized) disaster recovery approaches..."
				  </li>
				</ul>
			  </ul>
			  <li  class="dist_type">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>Description: This is the mid-tier of cloud computing. Along with all IaaS components, PaaS offers a
				  suite of services to support a web application's entire lifecycle including development tools, database
				  management, and business analytics.</li>
				<li>Benefits:</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>All the benefits of IaaS plus...</li>
				  <li>Reduces coding time. According to
					<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/">Microsoft's page on PaaS</a>, PaaS
					tools come with "pre-coded application components built into the platform, such as workflow,
					directory services, security features, search, and so on."
				  </li>
				  <li>Since the development environment is virtual, you and your team can work on your application remotely</li>
				  <li>All the tools you need to develop and manage a web app are included in PaaS</li>
				</ul>
			  </ul>
			  <li  class="dist_type">Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>Description: This is the most holistic version of cloud computing and also the most common. In
				  addition to the services described in IaaS and PaaS, SaaS provides hosted applications, such as
				  email, calendars, and customer Relationship Management (CRM).</li>
				<li>Benefits:</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>All the benefits of IaaS and PaaS plus...</li>
				  <li>Most applications can be run from the web, making your work accessible anywhere with an
					internet connection</li>
				  <li>The customer isn't responsible for updating the software</li>
				</ul>
			  </ul>
			</ul>
		        
			<p>
			  When it comes to asking "which type of cloud computing is right for me?", what you should really ask
			  yourself is, "how much of your company's IT do you want controlled by a third-party vendor?" <a
				href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/">This
			  graphic from Stephen Watts of <i>bmc blog</i> breaks down your options:</a>
			</p>
			<img src="iaas-paas-saas-comparison.jpg" alt="IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS" width="600px"/>
			<p>
			  If your needs are purely IT infrastructure based, go with an IaaS provider like Microsoft Azure or Digital
			  Ocean. If you're concerned with building and deploying web apps quickly, without having to worry about
			  software updates, look into PaaS providers like Heroku or Apache Stratos. If you want your company to deal
			  with as little IT as possible, SaaS is right for you. <a
				href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/">Watts
			  lists examples of all the different cloud computing types.</a> Some examples of SaaS providers he mentions are
			  Salesforce (CRM), Concur (Travel/Expense management), and Dropbox (file hosting).

			<h3>Models for Implementing Cloud Computing</h3>
			<p>Cloud Computing services are deployed in one of four ways:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Public Cloud</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>Description: Public clouds are available to the public and data are created and stored on third-party
				  servers. As server infrastructure belongs to service providers that manage and administer resources,
				  the need for user companies to buy and maintain their own hardware is eliminated.
				  Provider companies offer resources as a service on a free of charge or pay-per-use basis via an
				  internet connection. Users can scale them when required.</li>
				<li>Benefits:</li>
				  <ul>
					<li>Easy access to data,setup, and use</li>
					<li>Flexibility to add and reduce capacity</li>
					<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
					<li>Continuous operation time</li>
					<li>Full maintenance></li>
					<li>No need for software</li>
				  </ul>
			  </ul>
			  <li>Private Cloud</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>Description: The difference between public and private clouds is little from the technical point of
				  view, as their designs are very similar. However, unlike in the public cloud, only one specific company
				  owns a private cloud, which is why it is also called an internal or corporate cloud. Since these data
				  center architectures reside within the firewall, they provide enhanced security. Even though one
				  organization runs its workloads on a private basis, a third party can also manage it, and the server
				  can be hosted externally or on premises of the user company.</li>
				<li>Benefits:</li>
				  <ul>
					<li>Individual development</li>
					<li>Storage and network components are customizable</li>
					<li>High control over the corporate information</li>
					<li>High security,privacy and reliability</li>
				  </ul>
			  </ul>
			  <li>Community Cloud</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>Description: A community cloud deployment model is similar to a private one to a large extent; the
				  only difference is the set of users. While a private type implies that only one company owns the
				  server, in the case of a community cloud, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the same
				  infrastructure and related resources.
				</li>
				<li>Benefits:</li>
				  <ul>
					<li>Cost reduction</li>
					<li>Improved security,privacy and reliability</li>
					<li>Ease of data sharing and collaboration</li>
				  </ul>

			  </ul>
			  <li>Hybrid Cloud</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>Description:a hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of the above-mentioned cloud computing
				  deployment models--public, private and community. It allows companies to mix and match facets of all
				  three types that best suit their requirements. As an example, a company can balance its load by
				  locating mission-critical workloads on a secure private cloud and deploy less sensitive ones to a
				  public cloud. It not only safeguards and controls strategically important assets but does so in
				  the most cost effective way possible for each specific case.</li>
				<li>Benefits:</li>
				  <ul>
					<li>Improved security and privacy</li>
					<li>Enhanced scalability and flexibility</li>
					<li>Reasonable price</li>
				  </ul>
			  </ul>
